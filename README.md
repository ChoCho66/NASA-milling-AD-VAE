# ml-tool-wear
Demonstration of methods as described in my MASc thesis, "Feature Engineering and End-to-End Deep Learning in Tool Wear Monitoring."

**milling-tool-wear-beta-vae.ipynb** is the notebook that demonstates the use of the beta-VAE on the UC Berkeley milling data set. It also reproduces all the same figures from the thesis. The easiest way to get the notebook running is to use google colab (the notebook is optimize for it). No installation of packages required!
