# Feature Engineering and End-to-End Deep Learning in Tool Wear Monitoring
Demonstration of anomaly detection on the [UC Berkeley milling data set](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/) using a disentangled-variational-autoencoder (beta-VAE). The method is described in my MASc thesis, *Feature Engineering and End-to-End Deep Learning in Tool Wear Monitoring*.

**milling-tool-wear-beta-vae.ipynb** is the notebook to run. I recommend using google colab. The notebook is optimize for it, and no package installation required! Link below.
